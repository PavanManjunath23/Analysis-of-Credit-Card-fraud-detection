# Analysis-of-Credit-Card-fraud-detection
This repository contains code and analysis for detecting credit card fraud using various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Means, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Random Forest Classifier.

# Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the banking and financial sector to protect customers from unauthorized transactions. Machine learning techniques provide powerful tools to analyze patterns and detect fraudulent activities based on historical transaction data.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains a sample of credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine. It includes various features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical features derived from the transaction data.

# Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression: A binary classification algorithm that models the probability of a transaction being fraudulent based on input features.

K-Means: An unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups transactions into clusters based on similarity, potentially highlighting anomalous patterns.

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A supervised classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates transactions into fraudulent and genuine classes.

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning algorithm that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy in classification tasks.

# Results and Evaluation
Each algorithm is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance in detecting credit card fraud. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves are used to analyze the results and compare the effectiveness of different algorithms.
